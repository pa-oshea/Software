# DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle

DRY is a principle in software development that emphasizes the importance of avoiding code duplication by abstracting common functionality into reusable modules.

## Benefits of DRY

- Improved maintainability: code that's not duplicated in multiple places is easier to modify and maintain, reducing the likelihood of introducing errors.
- Increased productivity: reusing code can help developers build new features more quickly by avoiding unnecessary repetition.
- Better code organization: breaking code into reusable modules can help developers keep their codebase more organized and understandable.

## Techniques for achieving DRY

- Functions: using functions to encapsulate commonly used code.
- Libraries: reusing code from pre-built libraries or frameworks.
- Inheritance: using inheritance to avoid repeating code in subclasses.
- Templates: using templates to generate code from a single source.

## When to use DRY

The DRY principle should be used when you notice duplication in your code. By identifying patterns and similarities in your codebase, you can create reusable components that make your code easier to read, maintain, and test. However, it's important to balance DRY with other principles like simplicity and readability.

## When not to use DRY

Not all code duplication is bad. Sometimes, it may be simpler and more readable to write a small piece of code in-line rather than creating a separate reusable module. Additionally, over-engineering code to be DRY can lead to increased complexity and may be unnecessary for smaller projects.
