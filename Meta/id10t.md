# ID10T Error Cheatsheet

The term "ID10T error" is often used in the technology industry to refer to user errors that could have been avoided with a little more attention to detail. Here are some common examples of "ID10T errors":

- Entering incorrect information (e.g. mistyping a password)
- Ignoring error messages or warning prompts
- Failing to follow instructions or guidelines
- Misplacing or losing important files or documents

While it can be frustrating to encounter these errors, it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and most issues can be resolved with a little troubleshooting or guidance. If you're experiencing an issue, try taking a step back and double-checking your actions to see if there's something you missed. And if you're a technical support professional, remember to treat users with kindness and respect, even if their mistake seems obvious.
