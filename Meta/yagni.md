# YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) Cheatsheet

YAGNI is a programming principle that encourages developers to avoid adding unnecessary features or functionality to their code. This can help to reduce complexity, improve maintainability, and save time and resources. Here are some key things to keep in mind when applying the YAGNI principle:

## When to apply YAGNI

- **When adding new features:** Before adding a new feature, ask yourself whether it's really necessary. Will it provide value to users? Will it make the codebase more complex or harder to maintain? If the answer is no, don't add it.

- **When refactoring code:** When refactoring existing code, it can be tempting to add new functionality or improve performance. However, it's important to consider whether these changes are really necessary. If they don't solve a problem or provide value to users, they may not be worth the effort.

- **When writing tests:** When writing tests, it's important to focus on testing the behavior of the system, rather than specific implementation details. Avoid writing tests for features that aren't yet implemented or may not be necessary.

## How to apply YAGNI

- **Start small:** Begin with the smallest possible solution to a problem, and only add complexity when it's absolutely necessary.

- **Refactor often:** Regularly review your codebase and look for opportunities to simplify or remove unnecessary code.

- **Get feedback:** Solicit feedback from users and stakeholders to determine which features are truly valuable, and which can be discarded.

## When not to apply YAGNI

- **For critical functionality:** If a feature is essential to the core functionality of your application, it may be necessary to include it even if it adds complexity.

- **For performance optimization:** If performance is a critical requirement, it may be necessary to include optimizations even if they add complexity.

- **For future-proofing:** If a feature is likely to be needed in the future, it may be worth including it even if it's not strictly necessary at the moment.
