# Metasploit Framework

Metasploit is a free and open-source framework that is widely used by security professionals, researchers, and penetration testers for developing and executing exploits to identify and fix vulnerabilities in computer systems. However, it is important to use Metasploit responsibly and ethically, as it can also be used for malicious purposes.

## Basic Usage

1. Start Metasploit by opening a terminal window and typing the following command:

   ```bash
   msfconsole
   ```

2. Once Metasploit is started, use the `help` command to display a list of available commands.

   ```bash
   help
   ```

3. Use the `search` command to find an exploit module.

   ```bash
   search <module name>
   ```

4. Once you have found an exploit, use the `use` command to select it.

   ```bash
   use <module name>
   ```

5. Use the `show options` command to display the required options for the selected exploit.

   ```bash
   show options
   ```

6. Set the required options using the `set` command.

   ```bash
   set <option name> <value>
   ```

7. Use the `exploit` command to execute the selected exploit.

   ```bash
   exploit
   ```
