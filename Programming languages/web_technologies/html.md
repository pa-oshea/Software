# HTML Cheatsheet

HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Here are some tips on how to use HTML professionally:

## Structure

- Use a clear and well-organized structure for your HTML code. This will make it easier for others to read and understand your code, and help you avoid mistakes.
- Always use proper indentation to make your code easier to read and navigate.
- Use semantic HTML elements to give meaning to your code. For example, use the `<nav>` element for navigation links, `<article>` for content, and `<footer>` for the page footer.

## Best Practices

- Use valid HTML. Use a validator like the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check your code for errors.
- Keep your HTML code separate from your CSS and JavaScript code. Use external files for CSS and JavaScript, and link to them from your HTML file.
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for your IDs and classes. Avoid using generic names like "box" or "container".
- Use the alt attribute for images to improve accessibility for visually impaired users and to improve your website's SEO.

## Tags and Elements

- Use headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to structure your content and make it easier to read.
- Use the `<a>` tag for links, and use the href attribute to specify the URL.
- Use the `<img>` tag for images, and use the src attribute to specify the image file.
- Use the `<div>` tag for grouping related elements together, and use the class attribute to apply CSS styles to the group.
- Use the `<span>` tag for applying styles to individual text elements, and use the class attribute to apply CSS styles to the text.
