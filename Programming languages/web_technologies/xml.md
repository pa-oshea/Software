# XML Cheat Sheet

eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that provides a format for encoding and exchanging structured data. Here are some basic concepts and elements of XML.

## Document Structure

An XML document has a root element and can contain other elements, attributes, and text. The root element is defined as follows:

```xml
<root>
  <!-- other elements, attributes, and text -->
</root>
```

## Elements

An XML element is defined by a start tag, an end tag, and the content between them:

```xml
<element>Content</element>
```

An empty element can be defined as follows:

```xml
<element />
```

## Attributes

An attribute provides additional information about an element and is defined within the start tag of an element:

```xml
<element attribute="value">Content</element>
```

## Namespaces

A namespace is a collection of element and attribute names that are used to avoid naming conflicts in an XML document. A namespace is declared using the xmlns attribute:

```xml
<root xmlns="http://example.com/namespace">
  <!-- elements from the namespace -->
</root>
```

Validation

An XML document can be validated against a schema, which defines the structure, elements, and attributes that are allowed in the document. The most common schema languages for XML are XML Schema (XSD) and RelaxNG.

## Example

Here is a simple example of an XML document that describes a book:

```xml
<book>
  <title>The Great Gatsby</title>
  <author>F. Scott Fitzgerald</author>
  <year>1925</year>
</book>
```

## Conclusion

This cheat sheet provided an overview of the basic concepts and elements of eXtensible Markup Language (XML). To learn more, it is recommended to visit the [W3C XML specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) and the [MDN web docs.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML)
